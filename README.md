# Even/Odd Checker in Java

This project is a console-based Even/Odd Checker developed in Java.  
It takes an integer input from the user and prints whether the number is even or odd using basic conditional logic.

## Features
- Accepts an integer from the user via Scanner.
- Checks if the number is even or odd using modulo (%).
- Displays a clear output message in the console.

## Concepts Used
- Java basics (class, main method, variables).
- Conditional statements (if/else).
- Modulo operator (%) for parity checking.
- Input handling with `java.util.Scanner`.

## How to Run
1. Save the program as `EvenOdd.java`.
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac EvenOdd.java
3. Run   
   ```bash
   java EvenOdd
